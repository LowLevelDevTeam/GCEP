## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 High-Level Description
The engine is a modular system written in C++ (C++20 or later), designed to manage rendering, physics simulation, audio processing, and input handling in real-time.

### 2.2 System Context Diagram

    B --> C["Platform Hardware (GPU, CPU, Audio HW)"];
```

### 2.3 Major Components
- **Rendering Engine:** Handles graphics using APIs like OpenGL or DirectX.
- **Physics Engine:** Manages collision detection and physics simulations.
- **Audio Engine:** Processes sound effects and music.
- **Input Manager:** Captures keyboard, mouse, and gamepad events.
- **Game Logic:** Integrates modules via a scripting interface.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
- Render 3D graphics with dynamic lighting and shading.
- Perform real-time physics simulation and collision detection.
- Play background music and trigger sound effects.
- Capture and process user inputs.
- Provide a scripting interface for game behavior customization.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Maintain a minimum of 60 FPS.
- **Scalability:** Modular design for easy extension.
- **Portability:** Support Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Maintainability:** Clear code structure with thorough documentation.

### 3.3 Use Cases
- **Rendering:** Load and display complex scenes.
- **Physics:** Update object states and detect collisions.
- **Audio:** Manage and play audio assets.
- **Input:** Map user actions to game events.

### 3.4 Design Constraints and Assumptions
- Use modern C++ (C++20 or later).
- Rely on hardware-accelerated graphics.
- Assume a minimum hardware configuration for target platforms.

## 4. System Architecture & Design

### 4.1 Architectural Overview
The engine employs a component-based architecture. Each module has well-defined interfaces, ensuring loose coupling and isolated development.

### 4.2 Module Breakdown
- **Rendering Module:** Handles shaders, textures, and communicates with the GPU.
- **Physics Module:** Implements collision detection and rigid body dynamics.
- **Audio Module:** Interfaces with audio libraries (e.g., OpenAL).
- **Input Module:** Abstracts device-specific input.
- **Game Logic Module:** Manages scripting and event coordination.

### 4.3 Interaction Diagrams

```

### 4.4 Design Decisions and Rationale
- **Language Choice:** C++ for high performance.
- **Modular Design:** Supports isolated testing and independent module development.
- **TDD:** Ensures high code quality and early bug detection.

## 5. Detailed Module Design

### 5.1 Class Diagrams and Data Structures
- **Rendering:** `Renderer`, `Shader`, `Texture`
- **Physics:** `PhysicsEngine`, `Collider`, `RigidBody`
- **Audio:** `AudioEngine`, `Sound`, `MusicPlayer`
- **Input:** `InputManager`, `Controller`

### 5.2 Key Algorithms and Code Snippets

#### Basic Rendering Loop in C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Renderer.h"

int main() {
    Renderer renderer;
    if (!renderer.initialize()) {
        std::cerr << "Renderer initialization failed." << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }
    
    while (renderer.isRunning()) {
        renderer.processInput();
        renderer.updateScene();
        renderer.renderFrame();
    }
    
    renderer.shutdown();
    return 0;
}
````

### 5.3 Error Handling and Logging

- Utilize exception handling for critical errors.
- Implement a logging system to record runtime events and performance metrics.

---

## 6. Interface Design

### 6.1 Internal Interfaces

- Define clear APIs between modules using abstract classes or interfaces.

### 6.2 External APIs and File Formats

- Support standard file formats: OBJ (models), PNG (textures), WAV (audio).
- Provide documentation for external scripting interfaces.

### 6.3 User Interface (if applicable)

- Develop a debug UI for real-time performance monitoring and diagnostics.

## 7. Performance and Optimization

### 7.1 Performance Goals

- Consistently achieve 60 FPS.
- Optimize memory usage and processing overhead.

### 7.2 Profiling and Benchmarking

- Integrate profiling tools such as Valgrind or Visual Studio Profiler.
- Include benchmarking tests as part of the TDD suite.

### 7.3 Optimization Techniques

- Use object pooling and memory management best practices.

## 8. Testing Strategy (TDD Implementation)

### 8.1 Overview of TDD

- Write tests before implementation to drive design decisions and ensure code reliability.

### 8.2 Unit Testing

- Develop tests for individual components.
- **Example using Google Test:**

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "Renderer.h"

TEST(RendererTest, InitializeSuccess) {
    Renderer renderer;
    EXPECT_TRUE(renderer.initialize());
}
```

### 8.3 Integration Testing

- Verify that modules interact correctly through integration tests.

### 8.4 Regression Testing

- Maintain a suite of automated tests to catch and fix regressions early.

### 8.5 Testing Tools and Frameworks

- **Framework:** Google Test
- **CI/CD:** Automate testing with CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).
